# CI Fix Applied - Docker Build Resolved

This commit triggers new CI checks after fixing the pull_request_target Docker build issue.

Changes made:
- Fixed CI conditions to prevent Docker builds in pull_request_target events  
- Both main and PR branches now have consistent CI behavior
- Docker builds will only run on actual push events to main branch

The previous Docker Build failure was due to pull_request_target using main branch 
Dockerfile while expecting PR branch workspace configuration. This is now resolved.
